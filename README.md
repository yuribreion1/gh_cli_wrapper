# GitHub API Wrapper

Simplified version of GitHub REST APIs, created to practice and improve
my knowledge with Python and benefit anyone who has interest to use and
contribute.

## Setup

The source uses Conda packages provided by [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/)

To install dependencies, consider running the following command:

- `conda env create -f environments.yml`

## Usage

Once installed the dependencies, some commands are available as:

- **List All Repositories of an User**
  - `python main.py --function repo --owner owner_name --all`
